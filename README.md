# 0x11. C - printf

## Description

This is a collaboration project between Toluwani Ajibare and David John who are both students in the ALX Africa software engineering program.
This project involves a function named '\_printf'. The \_printf function will imitate the actual 'printf' command located in the <stdio.h> library.

## Prototype

> int \_printf(const char \*format, ...);

### Requirements

- All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.4 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files ended with a new line
- Code used the Betty style
- Global variables were not used
- The prototypes of all functions were included in the header file called 'main.h'
- All header files were include guarded

### Usage

- Prints a string to the standard output according to a given format.
- The \_printf() is a variadic function that accepts arguments and replaces the tags written in the strings.
- If the program runs successfully, the return value is the amount of chars printed or -1 otherwise.

### Example

Print the string of characters in "Hello World":

- Input: \_printf("Hello World!");
- Output: Hello World!

### Things to be learnt from the project.

- How to use GitHub for collaboration projects
- How to apply variadic functions
- The complexities of the printf function
- Finding a good workflow
